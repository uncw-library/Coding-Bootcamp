# Coding-Bootcamp

In this repository are the completed files that accompany a class was given to library staff members at UNCW Randall Library on 5/4/2018

Staff were asked to code along with Library IT developers and put together a working web application. The objective of the class was to give non library IT staff a better sense of how web applicatons within the lirbary are developed. We also discussed what information is available for the costruction of web applications and to think about what applications they might find useful in their departments.
